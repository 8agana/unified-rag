# Unified-RAG MCP Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified

1. **H2 Protocol Error**: The Qdrant client was trying to use HTTP/2 but encountering protocol errors
2. **Stdout Corruption**: Warning messages potentially corrupting JSON-RPC protocol
3. **Port Configuration**: Using HTTP port (6333) instead of gRPC port (6334)

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Changed Default Qdrant Port to gRPC (6334)
- Modified `src/service.rs` to use port 6334 by default instead of 6333
- The Qdrant Rust client works better with the gRPC port
- This avoids HTTP/2 protocol negotiation issues

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling for Protocol Issues
- Added better error detection for H2/HTTP2 protocol errors
- Provides clearer error messages suggesting to use gRPC port
- Increased timeout from 10 to 30 seconds for better reliability

### 3. Updated Test Script
- Modified `test_connection.sh` to test both HTTP (6333) and gRPC (6334) ports
- Updated default port display to show 6334
- Added explicit gRPC port connectivity test using netcat

## Verification

All print statements are correctly using `eprintln!` to write to stderr, preventing stdout corruption:
- `src/main.rs`: Uses `eprintln!` for all error messages
- No `println!` statements found in the codebase
- Tracing is configured to write to stderr

## Environment Variables

The MCP now expects these defaults:
- `QDRANT_HOST`: 127.0.0.1
- `QDRANT_PORT`: 6334 (changed from 6333)
- `QDRANT_PROTOCOL`: http
- `REDIS_HOST`: 127.0.0.1  
- `REDIS_PORT`: 6379
- `INSTANCE_ID`: CC

## Test Results

âœ… **Compilation**: Successful with only minor warnings about unused code
âœ… **Qdrant Connection**: Both HTTP (6333) and gRPC (6334) ports accessible  
âœ… **Redis Connection**: Port 6379 accessible via netcat test
âœ… **Service Initialization**: Successfully creates Qdrant collection and initializes
âœ… **Protocol Issues**: Resolved H2 protocol errors by using gRPC port

## Remaining Tasks

The MCP is now functionally working but needs:
1. Proper MCP protocol testing with JSON-RPC messages
2. Integration testing with Claude Desktop
3. Performance optimization for search operations

## Status

ðŸŸ¢ **Ready for Integration** - The MCP compiles, connects to services, and initializes properly. The major H2 protocol and stdout corruption issues have been resolved.
